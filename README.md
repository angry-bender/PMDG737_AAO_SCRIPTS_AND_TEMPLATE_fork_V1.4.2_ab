# Credit

This project is a fork of the already existing mod on flightsim.to https://flightsim.to/file/32603/pmdg737-axis-and-ohs-scripts-and-full-template-for-honeycomb-alpha-and-bravo by Andrew2448

# Usecase

This updates the existing configuration to add the following features

- Remove the cuttoff feature from the throttle axis
- Add in a flap lever that is compatable with the offical Honeycomb Bravo detents
- Add in a custom spoiler axis that has FligtDetent at a more logical location with detent being right at the bottom of the physical leaver, and up in the middle.

# Custom config
Thus template has even more, it includes rhe lights and some tweaks to the controls as detailed below

## Requirements for custom config
If you want to use the custom config you need to allow the sdk from %ROAMINGAPPDATA%\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\PMDG 73X\main.cfg

for **both** 738 and 737 (thus cought me out)
