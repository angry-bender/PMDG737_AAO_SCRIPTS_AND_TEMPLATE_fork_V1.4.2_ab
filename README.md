#Credit

This project is a fork of the already existing mod on flightsim.to https://flightsim.to/file/32603/pmdg737-axis-and-ohs-scripts-and-full-template-for-honeycomb-alpha-and-bravo by Andrew2448

# Usecase

This updates the existing configuration to add the following features

- Remove the cuttoff feature from the throttle axis
- Add in a flap lever that is compatable with the offical Honeycomb Bravo flap kit
- Add in a custom spoiler axis that has FligtDetent at a more logical location with detent being right at the bottom of the physical leaver, and up in the middle.
